# ParallelizationTests

Author: Darshan Thaker                    
This script can be used to test parallel vs. serial implementations. 

Preconditions: The parallel version of the program takes in a number of threads as its final command line parameter. The program should also output a line starting with 'Time:' to see how long the program took.                         
                                           
It will output the time taken for the old version, the new version, and the speedup of the program, which is defined as OLDTIME / NEWTIME
